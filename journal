The class was interesting. I have to accept that while doing the VPN activity I didn't get what we were doing but with the explanation I could understand how the VPN service work and what we were doing wrong.
Overall it was challenging to go in front of the class and explain something that I don't understand. But I guess i focused more in the task and follow the tutorial rather than be more curious and research about the different terms I don't know. I have to improve this.
