The network writing task was a challenge. I had to research but due to i'm not familiarized with some terms I also spent some time researching those terms. Networks is a hard topic for me, but I just need to research more if I want to understand it.

Today I also learned about "coffee script" which is a easy way to write jave script without being worried about the sintax of it. It's simmilar to pug for html.

I still think that it'd be useful to study databases, so we can understand how they work and apply that in our IAs. Which is a good way to practice the topics.
