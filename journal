Sep 12th

Today, we continued with the activity of creating a VPN Server with the raspberry Pi. Last class we divided the group in 2 so we had a raspberry for 3 people. I wanted this time to feel more useful, so I opted to do it myself as well.
I noticed the same errors I encounter last class. But researching different solutions for them was entertained and interesting.
Although I couldn't solve it at the end, I felt that I did my best. Unlike yesterday.
