sep 6th

The class it's going well. I already new about html but it was interesting to learn about the existance of pug.
I feel that these clases are entretained because we're learning a lot of small topics realted to CS.
Although I would also like to have some exercises realted with java programing, since it's the language that we're going to be assessed in.
