In today's class we learned some basic uses that we can give to the command app in MAC.

The activity was fun and challenging. I consider this as a good way to practice the computational thinking. 
I feel that Bash is interesting but confusing, probably because i am really use to jave syntax. Over all the rythm of the class is going well.
