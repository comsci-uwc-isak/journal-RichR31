In the 2nd last class we had, we learnt about recursion. In today's class we reviewed that topic by applying it to code. I think that I already learned the basic of recursion but one of the thing  I struggle the most doing is trying to picture in my head how could I actually apply that into a real program. Today's activity was one of those activites that allowed me to see for real the use of recursion.
For future classes, I would like to have simmilar programming activities for queues and stack. That, again, are topics I understand but that i have no clue how they look like in an actual implementation.
