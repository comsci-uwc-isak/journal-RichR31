In todays's class we had 2 options to work on: Webpage design (html, css and javascript) and Networking with RaspberryPi.
I chose to work with the raspberryPi. The task was to create a VPN server with one of the 2 raspberryPi we had available.
It was really confusing. Even though I was following a tutorial there was an error that made my group to be stuck. I tried to help as much as I could, but I don't understand it.
I think i will be better if everyone had their own RaspberryPi to work with, because i felt that I didn't do enough since we could only one PC setting everything up.
