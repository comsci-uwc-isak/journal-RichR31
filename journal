Today we had a test on the Topic 3 "networks"
The questions were challenging but were not impossible to answer after reviewing the topics. One of the questions that i found more difficult was one where a situation was stated and based on that, we had to find the problems within the network.
I don't feel like it was my best test ever but I feel proud of my keeping clamed during the test. Thanks to that I could have more time to analyze what the question was requiring me to answer.
