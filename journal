The class today was a little interesting. I'm saying this probably because I knew about html. I couldn't use pug becuase of my computer since I don't have admin rights.
The first part of the class was like a review about what I have already learned about html and css, but the homework we have to complete it's obviously more challenging: Create a flow chart diagram for the task to be perform properly.
I personally think that the initial explanation about encryptography was really interesting, and would like to have it a little longer.

I would like to have a class where we talk about databases, because I feel it's something that will help me a lot.
